# PyBLNET - a very basic python BL-NET bridge
[![Build status](https://github.com/dereisele/pyblnet/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dereisele/pyblnet/actions/workflows/build.yml)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/dereisele/pyblnet/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/dereisele/pyblnet?branch=master)

A package that connects to the BL-NET that is connected itself to a UVR1611 device by Technische Alternative. 
It is able to read digital and analog values as well as to set switches to ON/OFF/AUTO.

Documentation on the modules and their methods can be found with the methods and modules themselves.

Two interfaces to BLNet exist and both are supported:
- Webinterface  - Class BLnetWeb
- BLNet-Direct protocol [1] - Class BLNETDirect

BLNet-Direct is tested against responses recorded from a real BL-NET in DL mode (one UVR1611).
CAN and 2DL mode as well as reading logged data are still untested, so the web interface remains the safer choice there.

The class BLNET is a wrapper around the two classes. When initializing the class, the two interfaces can be activated/deactivated. 
BLNetDirect provides 'analog', 'digital',  'speed', 'energy', 'power', whereas BLnetWeb supports 'analog' and 'digital' only.
If both are active, BLNetDirect has priority.
Setting switches and reading their manual/auto state is only possible via the BLNetWeb interface.

### Installation

This fork is not published on PyPI. The `PyBLNET` package on PyPI is released by the upstream project and doesn't contain the changes made here.
Install it from GitHub instead (Python 3.11 or newer):

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/dereisele/pyblnet.git
# or a specific release
pip install git+https://github.com/dereisele/pyblnet.git@0.11.0
# or with uv
uv add git+https://github.com/dereisele/pyblnet.git
```

Each [release](https://github.com/dereisele/pyblnet/releases) also has the wheel and sdist attached.

### Usage

```python
from pyblnet import blnet_test, BLNET, BLNETWeb, BLNETDirect

ip = '192.168.178.10'

# Check if there is a blnet at given address
blnet_test(ip)  # -> True/False

# Convenient high level interface
blnet = BLNET(ip, password='pass', timeout=5)

# Control a switch by its ID
blnet.turn_on(10)
blnet.turn_auto(10)
blnet.turn_off(10)

# Fetch data (contains all available data using enabled interfaces)
print(blnet.fetch())

# The low level modules are also available
# note that the direct use of these modules is discouraged though

# Fetch the latest data via web interface
# Note that manual log in and log out are required
# when not using the with statement
with BLNETWeb(ip, password='pass', timeout=5) as blnet_session:
    print(blnet_session.read_analog_values())
    print(blnet_session.read_digital_values())

    # For publishing values
    blnet_session.set_digital_value('10', 'AUS')
    # Note that without explicit log out,
    # the BLNET will block any further web access for the next 150s
    # this is handled automatically when using the with statement

# Fetch data via the Protocol developed by TA
blnet = BLNETDirect(ip)
# Fetching the latest data
print(blnet.get_latest())
# Still inofficial because unexplicably failing often
print(blnet._get_data(1))
```
